    # John Company rules of Enlightenment
</header>

<div class="abstract">
    ## Foreward

    John Company is a unique and interesting board game. When everyone understands what they are doing, and it flows well. However in my opinion, it is let down by a poorly formatted rule book.

    <br/>

    This rule books is an attempt to explain the sections of John Company in a short and direct manner. It does not aim to fully replace the rules, and instead aims as a suppliment to make parts clear.
</div>

## What is John Company?

John Company is a game about running the East India Company. The John Company is looking to trade and invade India for it's own profit at the exploitation of India it's self.

In this game each player is playing as a family involved with the running of John Company. Their family members will work for different parts of the John Company, including gaining and losing jobs over the course of the game. Each player's aim is to enrich themselves, to become rich and powerful, and retire family members in luxury, which is all represented as victory points. At the of the game one player family will be declared the winner.

Progress through the game is made by working together in running the John Company. A player will usually only be able to run one part of the company at a time, and so negotiation and co-operation is key to making the company work. As the company succeeds players can gain rewards. Negotiation, backstabbing, and greed, is key to exploiting both India and the company to enrich yourself over others.

The game is played over a series of rounds. In each round there is a phase of individual player actions, then phases of running the company through it's various offices, and then phases for the actions in India and upkeep.

The game ends when you reach the final round without the company failing, and the company has survived. If the company fails then the game will end early. In both cases the scores will be calculated, and a winning player will be decided.

## Negotiations

In John Company you can negotiate to make trades. You can trade assets (like money, shared, or shipyards), and also make promises to fullfill with other players in the future. Of note:

 - A trade can be between two or more players.
 - When trading items, they cannot be _'activated twice'_. For example if I have collected £1 from my Shipyard and give it to you, you cannot then take another £1 until the following turn.
 - If the trade is an *immediate* transfer (i.e. I will trade you 4 gold for your shipyard), it is binding, and must be fullfilled by both parties.
 - If the trade involves something in the future (i.e. I will make you Master of Trade if you promise to purchase ships from my shipyards), then players may go back and break this deal in the future.

### What can you trade?

 - your personal family gold
 - your family Promise cards
 - shares in the John Company (this does not include the Office of the Chairman)
 - shares in Firms
 - Shipyards (with or without the fitted ship)
 - Workshops
 - Luxuries
 - London Season Enterprise cards
 - Longon Season Blackmail cards (you may show them the blackmail card before the trade)
 - ... and promises on what actions you will do on your future turns.

Nothing else can be traded. This includes Offices, Officers, Writers, the London Season Spouse cards, and anything else not mentioned here.

## Phases of a round

First there are phases for the players to improve their own position:

 1. *Vote on Deregulation* -- An optional extension which allows you to start Firms by passing the Deregulation law.
 2. *London Season* (note this is skipped on the first round) -- On this phase the Offices may take fatigue and may retire, players may retire them to Prizes (manor houses for them to live), and receive London Social cards they can utilise during the game.
 3. *Family Action* -- Players may take independant actions to put their family pieces onto the board, or invest to add things to their family empire.
 4. *Firms* -- If you pass Deregulation law, then in this phase a Player Family may start and run their own independent company.

Next are the phases for running the John Company:

<div class="counter-wrap" style="counter-set: count 4">
 5. *Hiring* -- Player family members may be hired into any vacant Offices that are currently available.
 6. *Chairman* -- The Chairman of the company takes the company balance, and deals it out to each office in the company.
 7. *Directory of Trade* -- this position may open trade routes in India, for later offices to make trades.
    - *or Governor General* -- an optional extension that replaces the Directory of Trade if the Governor General law has been passed. This role takes actions to govern _all_ of the companies regions in India.
 8. *Manager of Shipping* -- this office purchases ships for the John Company, for later offices to make trades.
 9. *Military Affairs* -- this office deals with moving Officers in Training into the Army, and moving the regiments and Officers between the three armies.
 10. *Presidency of Bombay* -- in charge of the John Companies events in the Bombar region (in the middle left of India). They may fullfill trades in the Bombay region, and choose when the Military Commander and Governors of the region takes place.
    - *Army Commander of Bombay* -- they may deploy troops to police company area to stop unrest, or invade neighbouring regions of India.
    - *Governors* (of the vaious regions in India) -- these exist later in the game as the John Company takes over regions in India. They may tax regions, raise regiments, or build ships. They may also cause unrest.
 11. *Presidency of Madras* -- the same as the Presidency of Bombay, but based out of Madras (in the bottom right of India).
 12. *Presidency of Bengal* -- also the same as the Presidency of Bombay and Madras, but based out of Bengal (in the top right of India).
 13. *Superintendent of Trade China** -- an optional extension created by the Directory of Trade, or when passing the law Envoy to China. This office may trade opium with China.
</div>

Next are phases for financial changes:

<div class="counter-wrap" style="counter-set: count 13">
 14. *Bonuses* -- players recieve money from their Enterprises (Workshops and Shipyards).
 15. *Revenue* -- Company upkeep and profits
   - *Player Firms* (optional extension) -- any player Firms pay their upkeep, may go bankrupt, and may pay out dividends.
   - *John Company* -- The John Company pays it's upkeep, may issue dividends, and update company standing (how well it is performing commercially).
</div>

Then two phases for external effects taking place:

<div class="counter-wrap" style="counter-set: count 15">
 16. *Events in India* -- Events take place in India that are out of the companies control. This includes storms that destroy ships, uprising, and invasions. This is what the elephant marching around the board is about.
 17. *Parliament Meets* -- New laws can be passed (or fail) which will affect the players, the John Company, and India.
</div>

Finally:

<div class="counter-wrap" style="counter-set: count 17">
 18. *Upkeep & Refresh* -- Players pay their family costs (such as for people they are have retired), and you refresh the board for the next round.
</div>

The game can end with:

 - **Company Success** - when you reach the end of the final round
 - **Company Bankrupcy** - immediately if the Company Standing reaches 0

## Playing

There are _many_ steps in a round of John Company. Run through each of the sections in order.
Be aware that some of these you can skip.

## 1. *Vote on Deregulation*

<div class="note">
   This is only present if the Deregulation card is available to vote on.
</div>

In this phase players vote if they should pass the Deregulation law or not.
The Deregulation vote can only take place if:

 - The Prime Minister *may* intiate the vote, if the Company Debt or Company Standing is on a lined circle.
 - The Prime Minister *must* intiate the vote, if the Company Debt or Company Standing is on a starred circle.

There are some differences to this vs other laws:

 - The Prime Minister can vote _against_ the law,
 - and if the vote fails, the Prime Minister will not lose their job.

### If the vote passes

 - Halve the Company Debt, rounded up. i.e. 4 changes to 2, and 5 changes to 3.
 - Move the Company Standing to the S space.
 - The Prime Minister gains a Passed Law token.
 - Flip the Deregulation law card to show the Debtors Prison, and place this on the side of the board.

### If the vote fails

 - Increase the value of the Company Shares, by placing the company share victory overlay from the box over the company shares cost.
   - If the marker has already been placed, then flip it to the higher value.
   - If it has already been flipped, do nothing.
 - Put the law back to the side of the board face up (do not discard).
 - The law may be voted on again in the next round.

## 2. *London Season*

<div class="note">
   This is skipped on the first round.
</div>

### Firm Retirments

All players who have at least one share in any Firms, may perform *one* retirement. If they own multiple shares in multiple Firms, it's still just *one* retirment.

 - Take one family member _from your supply_,
 - and then pay up to the current value of the Firm on the Company Balance track to place them onto a Prize. i.e. If the Firm value is £9, then you may place an £8 Prize.

### John Company Retirements

In this phase all Players roll to check the health of their Family members who hold office positions. They either gain fatigue, or retire.

First:

 - Roll 1 dice for each family member who holds an Office.
 - If they are the Chairman, add another +1 to the result.
 - Then +1 to the result for each Fatigue Cube on their Office card.

Dice Results:

<div class="dice">
 -  1️⃣ /  2️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family member is unchanged.
 -  3️⃣ /  4️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add a fatigue cube to their Office card.
 -  5️⃣ /  6️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family member retires. They are moved to the pensioner box, and their Office card moves to the Vacant Offices box.
</div>

### London Season Cards -- todo

## 3. *Family Actions* -- TODO, fill out the family actions

Starting with the Chairman (or former Chairman), and working clockwise, each player in turn must take one Family Action.

These actions are:
 - *Enlist Writer* -
 - *Enlist Officer* -
 - *Purchase Luxury* -
 - *Purchase Shipyard* -
 - *Purchase Workshop* -
 - *Seek Share* -

### At the end redeem new Company Shares

<div class="note">
   If no one bought a new share then skip this phase.
</div>

People who seeked a new share need to be moved from the Stock Exchange to the Company Court. They can only move in if there is Company Debt (it's higher than 0), and those who paid the most get priority.

Working through the Stock Exchange from the most expensive to the least (right to left):

 - Move the company debt track down by 1,
 - Move that Family member into the company Court,
 - If the company debt track reaches 0, then stop.
 - Any Family members on the Stock Exchange remain, and are moved to the most expensive positions on the right for the next round. Preserve their order in cost.

## 4. *Firms*



## 5. *Hiring*

## 6. *Chairman*

## 7.a. *Directory of Trade* is on board (the default)

## 7.b *Governor General* is on board

The rules for playing the Governor General are:
 - Increase the Company Revenue by £3 for each company controlled region in India.
 - Then the Governor General may attempt to Govern any number of times by rolling dice.
   - Pay £1 for each dice to use.

Rolls:

<div class="dice">
 -  1️⃣ /  2️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *For each* region, choose a govern option (see below)
 -  3️⃣ /  4️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may try again
 -  5️⃣ /  6️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are fired
 - &nbsp;For any result, add one Unrest cube *in each* company controlled region
</div>

If successful, you must do one of the following for *each* company controlled region:
 - Place a Company Ship directly into any Sea Zone,
 - Place a Regiment from the supply into the Army,
 - Tax the population for £2. The money goes to the Company Balance, or to another Offices treasury (can't be the Governor General).
   - Place an Unrest cube into a Company Region.
   - If you choose to tax multiple regions, you must place the Unrest into a different region for each.

Payout: take £1 into your personal funds for each Company Region.

## 8. *Manager of Shipping*

This Office phase buys or leases ships for the John Company.
The rules are:

 - They must spend all of their money until they have at least £2 left.
 - All money goes to the bank.
 - When they purchase a ship, they may place it in any of the seas (including China).

The ships that can be bought are:

 - £2 - A Leased Ship (black) - This is a temporary ship that is returned at the end of the round.
 - £3 - A Fitted Ship (blue) - Purchase a Fitted Ship from a players Shipyard.
 - £5 - A Company Ship (red) - Purchase a red Company Ship. You can only do this if there are no Fitted Ships available.

## 9. *Military Affairs*

## 10. *Presidency of Bombay*

## 10.b. *Army Commander of Bombay*

## 10.c. *Governors* (of the vaious regions in India)

## 11. *Presidency of Madras*

This is the same as the Presidency of Bombay, but played from the Presidency of Madras office on the board and region in India.

## 12. *Presidency of Bengal*

This is also the same as the Presidency of Bombay and Madras, but for Bengal.

## 13. *Superintendent of Trade China**

<div class="note">
   This area counts as the Eastern Sea Zone.
</div>

The office may attempt a trade with China. If chose to then:
 - Roll 1 dice for each ship in the Superintendent of Trade in China sea.

<div class="dice">
 -  1️⃣ /  2️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For each Opium Export icon under company control;<br />increase the company balance by £4, and take £1 for yourself
 -  3️⃣ /  4️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing happens
 -  5️⃣ /  6️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are fired
</div>

## 14. *Bonuses*

All players take £1 for each Shipyard with a fitted ship on the board, and £1 for each Workshop.

## 15.a. Revenue for Player Firms (optional expansion)

<div class="note">
   If there are no player Firms, then skip this section and go to the next Revenue phase.
</div>

If any players have a Firm you will need to:

 - work out the order each Firm will perform this stage
 - pay out expenses
 - deal with Firms who go bankrupt
 - and optionally pay out Firm dividends

### Ordering

The Firms must do this round in a specific order. This is relevant if a Firm cannot afford the upkeep and will go bankrupt before others.

The exact ordering is:

 - First all firms who had made trades, and had an initiative.
    - Firms with the lowest intitiative are first to the highest.
    - Ties are broken by whoever made their trade first.
 - Then all other Firms.
    - Ties are broken by the Firm Manager with the most Windows first, through to the lowest,
    - If there is still a tie then it is clockwise from the Prime Minister, starting with them.

### Pay Expenses

The cost for each Firm to pay is:

  - £1 for each ship in the Firm.
  - £1 for each share in the Firm, or the Firm's £ value. Whichever is higher.
  - The cost goes to the bank.
  - These costs can be paid from the Firm's London or India treasuries (or both).

If a Firm cannot pay these expenses, then they will be dissolved.

### Firm dividends

If a Firm was profitable, then the *Firm Manager* may choose to pay dividends out from the India trasury.

<div class="note">
   If the Firm Hobnobbed, then skip this part entirely. Do not update the Company Balance track for the Firm.
</div>

#### Steps to perform

 - The Manager may pay out multiple rounds of Dividends.
 - The money is paid from the Firm's India Treasury.
 - In each round of Dividends pay £1 to each Firm Shareholder, and £1 to the Firm Manager.
 - An individual Shareholder or Manager may choose to _not_ receive a dividend, if they and the Manager both agree.
 - Finally the Manager places one of their Firm Cubes on the Company Balance track (the same one John Company uses), to show the _total_ number of dividends paid this turn (i.e. the Firm paid two dividends of £4, so you update the board to show 8). This is skipped if the Firm Hobnobbed.

#### Finally

Move any remaining cash from the Firm's India Treasury to the London Treasury.

#### If a Firm is dissolved

A firm must dissolve if it cannot pay it's expenses. There are two ways out of this:

 - **Emergency Investments** -- Any player may invest in the Firm to give it funds.
    - Like in the Firm phase:
        - Flip a Workshop, or remove a share from John Company, to pay for the investment.
        - The Firm receives £5.
        - The Firm Manager must agree.
        - note: You can invest beyond 10 shares, just no new shares get added.
    - any left over money from the investment is given to the bank (it is lost).
    - lower the Firm's value by 1 for each Emergency Investment

 - **Emergency Mergers** -- A Firm may negotiate a merger with another Firm (or several).
    - The other Firm must still pay their own expenses (if they have not done so already you can wait until their turn to merge).
    - The other Firm must also be able to pay _your_ expenses as well.
    - Then follow the rest of the Firm merger rules in the Firms phase.

*If the above fails* then the firm must be dissolved. The player will:

 - Move any money in the Firm's London & India treasuries to the bank (it was used to pay what expenses it could).
 - Move all shareholders on the Firm board to the Debters Prison (the back of the Deregulation card).
 - Move all ships in the Firm back to their Shipyards.
 - Flip the Firm board back over the Family board.
 - _Note: if any Workshops were flipped to invest in the firm, do not flip them back. They remain in their invested state for the rest of the game!_

### 15 *Revenue* for the John Company

First the company needs to pay for upkeep. All costs come out of the Company Balance track. These costs are:

 - £1 for each company debt on the Company Debt track.
 - £1 for each each Regiment and Officer in the Indian Armies (do not include officers in training, or Commanders).
 - £1 for each ship (extra, fitted, and company ships) in the Indian and Chinese seas.

### If the company doesn't have enough money

In the event the company cannot afford it's expenses, then:

 - You *must* take out debt, taking £5 at a time, until all expenses are paid off.
 - For each debt move the debt marker one more to the right on the Company Debt track.
   - If you reach the end you can continue to take on debt, and the marker doesn't move anymore.
   - The interest of this additional debt doesn't count this turn, as you just took it. It counts next turn.
 - Any leftover money is lost. Leave the Company Balance at 0.
 - If one or two Company Debt were taken, then lower the Company Standing by 1.
 - If three or more Company Debt were taken, then lower the Company Standing by 2.
 - If the Company Standing reaches 0, the company has failed. The game has ended and immediately go to the Company Bankruptcy phase.

### Company Expectations

 - Check the balance below the current Company Standing.
 - If the Company Balance is less, decrease the Company Standing by 1.
 - If the Company Standing reaches 0, the company has failed. The game has ended and immediately go to the Company Bankruptcy phase.

### Dividends

The *Chairman* may choose to pay out one or many rounds of dividends, or none at all.

 - The Chairman may pay out multiple rounds of Dividends.
 - In a round of dividends each Shareholder and the Chairman receives £1 from the Company Balance.
 - A round of dividends can only take place if there is enough to pay all Shareholders and the Chairman. No one can skip.
 - Then check the balance below the current Company Standing.
 - If the company paid out _more_ in dividends than this balance, increase the Company Standing by 1.

## 16. *Events in India*

### Rolling
The events in India works first with a dice roll. The result has you check for storms damaging ships, and then run through a certain number of India cards.

 - Roll the Events in India die (it's the big blue die).

Dice results:

<div class="dice">
 - 1️⃣ with 3x storms &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll storms for all ships in all seas (including in China), and take 1 event in India card.
 - 2️⃣ with W storm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll storms for all ships in the West sea, and take 2 event in India cards.
 - 2️⃣ with E storm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll storms for all ships in the East sea (and in China), and take 2 event in India cards.
 - 3️⃣ with S storm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll storms for all ships in the South sea, and take 3 event in India cards.
 - 4️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take 4 event in India cards (there were no storms).
</div>

### Storms

When a storm occurs, all ships in a region need to be checked if they have been damaged or destroyed. This is done by:

 - For each ship in that region ... (China is included as a part of the East India sea),
 - roll 1d6 for each *fitted* ship (the blue ones), and check the results below.

<div class="dice">
 -  1️⃣ or 2️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing happens (the ships is safe).
 -  3️⃣ or 4️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the ship is healthy, flip it to be damaged. If it's already damaged, return it to it's shipyard (it was destroyed).
 -  5️⃣ or 6️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return it to it's shipyard (it was destroyed).
 - &nbsp;Ships are returned in their *healthy* (blue) state.
</div>

### Events

<div class="note">
   This part of the game is, by far, the most confusing and complicated.
   Don't be surprised if it takes a while to get through this the first few times.
</div>

 - For each Event in India card you rolled on the big blue die, take and read a card from the India cards pile.
 - You resolve the cards taken *one at a time*, until all cards are resolved.
 - For each Event type, do one of the following.

#### Windfall

 - Look at the region name on the card face down at the top of the India draw deck,
 - Players receive £1 from the bank for each Writer they have in that region,
 - and players receive £1 from the bank for each Writer they have in an adjacent region.
 - Then discard this card.

#### Shuffle

 - Perform the Elephant's March! (see below).
 - Then shuffle this Shuffle card, back into the remaining India draw deck.
 - Then shuffle the discarded India cards, and place them back on top of the India draw deck.

#### Turmoil

 - Look at the region name on the card face down at the top of the India draw deck.
 - Look for the northernmost order in the region (from the top of the draw stack), that is still open or filled,
   - Change that order to be closed.
   - If the order was filled with a Writer placed on top, return the writer to it's owners supply, and change this to a regular closed order token.
 - If all orders in the region are already closed, perform a cascade! (see below).

#### Leader

 - Look at the region name on the card face down at the top of the India draw deck.
 - If that region is soverign (no flag, or it has a big flag), then add an extra level to it's tower (you are done).
 - If the region is dominated, then rebel:
   - Add up the towers of the current rebelling region, plus the modifier on the card.
   - Add up the towers of the parent Empire (all it's regions excluding the current region).
   - If the rebellion value is higher, then remove the flag from this region.
   - If the rebellion value is less or equal, then remove a tower from the Capital (if there is one).
 - Otherwise if the region is owned by the company:
   - Add up the number of unrest cubes in the rebelliong region (if any), plus the modifier on the card.
   - The company army for that region, *must* exhaust troops up to the strength of the rebellion, or as many as possible. Whichever is lower.
   - If the company strength is equal or greter than the rebellion, then the rebellion ends.
      - Remove all unrest cubes from this region.
      - Move the army regiment tokens used to the exhaust side of the army box (they cannot be used again this turn).
      - Re-run this process for *all company regions with unrest cubes*, but without the modifier from the card.
      - TODO, the rest of this!
   - If the Elephant was standing in the middle of this region, then perform an Elephant's move!

#### Peace -- todo
#### Crisis -- todo
#### Foreign Invasion -- todo

#### Elephant's March (from multiple cards)

This happens on multiple cards. The Elephant is marching around India, and it represents who is attacking who during rebellions and such.

When it comes up first:

 - Look at the region name on the top face down card on the India draw deck. The elephant moves to there.

Then check each of the following in order, and perform the first action that applies:

 - If the region is owned by the John Company, move the elephant into the middle of that region.
 - If the region is dominated by an empire (it has a little flag), then place the Elephant on the border facing it's soverign (it has a big flag).
 - If the region is the centre of an Empire (it has a big flag), and has conquered all it's surrounding regions (they all have a little matching flag), then:
   - Look for the shape on the inside border of the region that matches the India card you have (it's a triangle, circe, or square).
   - Place the Elephant on the border there.
   - The Elephant must face *into* the centre of the Empire (towards the big flag).
 - Finally look for the shape on the inside border of the region that matches the India card you have (it's a triangle, circe, or square).
   - If the other side has not been conquered by the current region, place the Elephant onto the border there. It is facing into the unconquered region.
   - Otherwise move the Elephant clockwise along the borders, until you find an unconquered region. It sits on the border there.

#### Cascade (from multiple cards)

When you are asked to close an order in a region, sometimes the orders are all closed already. That causes a cascade.

In that case:

 - Close all orders in the neighbouring regions, which are open or filled, and connect to this regions.
   - If the connected order was already filled, pick the northernmost open or filled order.
      - If all orders are filled, perform the cascade again in that region!
      - Each region can only cascade once.
   - If an order was filled with a Writer placed on top, return the writer to it's owners supply, and change this to a regular closed order token.

## 17. *Parliament Meets*

## 18. *Upkeep & Refresh*

 1. On this turn each player *must* pay the upkeep for each Prize (a retired family member in a manor) that they have.
    - The cost is the white circle in the top left of their Prize manor, to the right of the purple cost.
    - Each Prize is paid for individually. If you can pay for some and not others, you must pay for the ones you can afford.
    - For each Prize you cannot pay the upkeep for, remove that family member from the board back to your supply, and the victory points they had are lost.
 2. Move all exhausted Military Officers and Regiments back to the upper side of the Army (they are ready for the next turn).
 3. Move all purchased local Military Alliances back to the exhausted (lower side) of the Army box.
 3. Return all Writers on a filled order back to their Presidencies Writers box.
 4. Remove all Filled Order tokens on a filled order from the board (put them back in the game box supply).
 5. Move to the next round, and move the turn marker back to the first phase and run the London Season.
    - If it was the final round, then run the end game section.

## End of the Game

At the end of the game players can no longer negotiate with each other, or make any trades.
What they have is all they have.

### If a player has a share in a firm

All players who have at least one share in any Firms, may perform *one* retirement. If they own multiple shares in multiple Firms, it's still just *one* retirment.

 - Take one family member _from your supply_,
 - and then pay up to the current value of the Firm on the Company Balance track to place them onto a Prize. i.e. If the Firm value is £9, then you may place an £8 Prize.
 - You may use Spouse cards to reduce the cost.

### If the Company Survives

If you reach the end of the last round, then the company survived. In this phase all players must check if their family members retire, and may place them on Prizes. Again, no trades can take place to receive any money.

 - Each player rolls attrition for their family members in an office, to check if any retire.
 - Any familiy members who retire, may be placed into a Prize using the usual Prize rules.
 - No London Season cards are drawn.

### Company Bankrupcy

If the Company Standing ever reaches 0, then the game immediately ends.
In this end you must:

 - Draw a Company Failed card, and then resolve what happens.

### Scoring

 - TODO
 - TODO, there is bits on the Firm Value needed to be accounted for here
 - TODO, include Debters Prison
